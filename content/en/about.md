I am Eltrac! This is my blog where I write about nearly everything I am interested in, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, computer science and stuff.

To quote one of my favorite podcasters[^1], consider this website as a **monologue of a committed observer**.

Most of the articles are in Chinese, you can check them out by clicking the little globe icon on the top navigation.

## About Me

Born-and-raised Chinese, I'm currently studying Software Engineering at a university in China, trying to get my bachelor's degree. I've been thinking about continuing my study somewhere in Europe and getting a master's degree in Game Design or Game Development.

I'm gay and go with no specific pronouns. Call me him or them or her or whatever suits you.

If you'd like to know about me a little bit more, please read something that I wrote on this blog. I don't want to make this page too autobiographical.

## About this blog

Geek Death Project is originally a Chinese blog. In the beginning of 2025, I've decided to make it bilingual and start writing stuff in English as a way to improve my written English, considering that I might go abroad and take courses in English.

Also, I'd like to write about stuff that is happening on the English Internet or something that Chinese people do not pay much attention to.

## About the names

My name is Eltrac, which is not a real name but a word that I made up. It's just a name that I go by on the Internet.

The blog is called Geek Death Project, it's sort of two-fold.

1. Means *Killing the geek*. I used to spend way too much time on trying new productivity tools and re-decorating my websites, rather than creating anything truly valuable. I'd like to *kill* that version of me.
2. Break it into three individual nouns.
   1. "Geek" means I write about computer stuff and dig deep into some topics like a geek.
   2. "Death" is kind of philosophical. See it as a symbol of everything that is related to the ultimate answer of life or other similar things worth writing about.
   3. "Project" is more of a placeholder, making the title sounds like a real name of something. But I do love creating all sorts of personal projects.
